        <p>Practice Mentor: An App For Budding Musicians</p>
      </header>
    </div>
    <p> The project covers an interactive system design process from the initial formulation of a design problem to creation of digital prototypes. It was created over a semester for a course in interaction design. Showcased below are artifacts that represent different design process stages (sketches, wireframes, storyboards, low-fi prototypes, etc.) In the end, I learned to justify and defend design methods and decisions from a process-focused and context-specific perspective. </p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>Children respond differently to the challenge of a daily musical instrument practice routine, though most at some point react negatively.  At best, they exhibit disinterest, at worst, screaming resistance. Displeasure in developing a regular practice routine obstructs getting lifelong enjoyment from an instrument. What children often lack is the guiding presence of an authority figure during daily at-home practice who can provide emotional reassurance, practice structure, and new techniques. Schools and private teachers only provide supervised training one to two times per week, and parents cannot cover the difference. Most parents exhaust their time and energy on basic care and prioritize help with homework with what remains. </p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>

    <p>I propose a technological and social intervention, in this case, an app to bring together two populations: (1) households with young children learning instruments; (2) local teenagers interested in volunteer opportunities for college applications or general altruism. The app will offer a set of features to create a practice mentorship between the teens and young children.  </p>
    <p>Teens and parents will use the app as a matching platform. Traveling to the homes of parents, mentor teens will sit with mentee children while they practice. The app will host training modules for the mentors and real time practice assistance in the form of interactive educational games. Musically inexperienced mentors, in particular, will make use of these features. </p>

    <h2>Final Design Functionality and Features</h2>

    <p> Allow potential mentors to post a bio - Lets parents know more about the all-around person they might be admitting to their home. Videos allow mentors to demonstrate commitment through the extra effort required to make one. More robust bio pages ensure confidence from parents at first meeting, improving odds of future rapport.</p>
    <p> Allow potential mentors to invite character references to post letters of recommendation along with their contact information and availability - Lets parents know that the mentors are trustworthy and verify by contacting the source.</p>
    <p> Allow parents of mentees to select a mentor and establish contact with the mentor - Lets parents feel a sense of control over the process. Provides them with filters allowing them to specify desire for a mentor with a specific instrument skillset, completed number of training modules, number of references, available weekly timeslots, and posted profile videos. </p>
    <p> Provide mentors with training modules on effective practice mentorship - Shortens the time mentors need to become effective and maximizes their impact. This is particularly important for musically inexperienced mentors. </p>
    <p> Provide all users with practice exercises, games, and strategies to use in real time - Gives mentors (and parents if need be) an extra toolkit in helping a child through a practice. </p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>This solution allows a community to solve one problem with another. One subcommunity lacks a resource, and the other lacks an outlet. Mentees derive the benefit of long term musical appreciation. Mentors with musical experience derive the benefit of concretizing their musical knowledge through some of the teaching that will naturally occur in this platform. Both musically experienced and inexperienced mentors will learn responsibility through the program and the value of community service. Young adults may fear community service, associating it with discomfort in confronting at-risk or disadvantaged populations. These teenagers may enter adulthood without first-hand experience of what feelings community service brings. This would offer a first step into the world of service through an action that is achievable and impactful: walking into the home of one neighbor and sitting down with a child to help them learn.</p>
